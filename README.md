The objective is make a physics engine from zero;
we maked a set of cannons that will fire, if one hits the o other
wins, there is a power up where the balls gets bigger for one turn.

The engine is made up of:
-Forces that control the granada, such speed, acceleration, drag, gravity and boyancy.
-The engine is also made up of various formulas such as Newton's 2nd law, integrators and a collision system.
